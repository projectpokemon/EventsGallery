## Instructions
To import these files into your save, use PKHeX's block importing function. Our [tutorial](https://projectpokemon.org/tutorials/save-editing/gen-8_157/block-editing-r106/) should guide you through it.
Our first post of [this page](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/56121-swsh-blocks-and-save-research/) would contain some data relevant to the importing stage.


## [Wild Area Event #00](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4108-wild-area-event-00/)
These are the base files for the Wild Area Event, when the user have yet to collect any Mystery Gifts nor update the wild area news.

Even though the index of the files are 01, these files are almost null throughout, different from the real index 01 files.


## [Wild Area Event #1: Butterfree, Drednaw & Corviknight](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4026-wild-area-event-1-butterfree-drednaw-corviknight/)
This is the first wild area event held by Sword and Shield. Despite publicizing that Gigantamax variants for Butterfree, Drednaw and Corviknight were to be more easily available, this event also allowed encounters for the Gigantamax variants for Sandaconda and Centiskorch.

Drednaw and Sandaconda were Sword exclusive raids, and Corviknight and Centiskorch were Shield exclusive raids.
Though it is important to note, host can include players of the opposite version to join in the raids.

This event ran globally from November 15th to December 4th, 2020


## [Wild Area Event #2: Snorlax](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4027-wild-area-event-2-snorlax/)
This wild area event held by Sword and Shield. It made Gigantamax Snorlax the focus of the event.
For base game Pokémon Sword and Shield, without this event, there is no den that will enable players to encounter a Gigantamax Snorlax.

As per the previous events, Drednaw and Sandaconda were Sword exclusive raids, and Corviknight and Centiskorch were Shield exclusive raids. Butterfree and Snorlax can be obtained regardless of game.
Though it is important to note, host can include players of the opposite version to join in the raids.

This event ran globally from December 4th, 2019 to January 9th, 2020.
The running of this event was interrupted twice in favor of other events:
#3 Christmas 2019 (Index 03 and Index 04)
#5 New Years 2020 (Index 06)


## [Wild Area Event #3: Christmas 2019](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4028-wild-area-event-3-christmas-2019/)
This wild area event held by Sword and Shield. It made Delibird the focus of the event, to celebrate Christmas 2019
While Delibird crashes the #2 event, it merely shifts the spawns. As such, Gigantamax Snorlax is still available, just at a lower rate.
For base game Pokémon Sword and Shield, without this event, there is no den that will enable players to encounter a Gigantamax Snorlax.

As per the previous events, Drednaw and Sandaconda were Sword exclusive raids, and Corviknight and Centiskorch were Shield exclusive raids. Butterfree and Snorlax can be obtained regardless of game.
Though it is important to note, host can include players of the opposite version to join in the raids.

This event ran globally from December 20th to December 25th, 2019.
When this event ended, it shifted back to Wild Area Event #2 (Index 05 in this case).


## [Wild Area Event #4: New Years 2020](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4029-wild-area-event-4-new-years-2020/)
This wild area event held by Sword and Shield. It made Magikarp the focus of the event, with a high chance to encounter one shiny, to celebrate New Years 2020. The Shiny Magikarp is a 8% guaranteed spawn, across all tiers.
While Magikarp crashed the #2 event, it merely shifted the spawns. As such, Gigantamax Snorlax is still available, just at a lower rate.
For base game Pokémon Sword and Shield, without this event, there is no den that will enable players to encounter a Gigantamax Snorlax.

As per the previous events, Drednaw and Sandaconda were Sword exclusive raids, and Corviknight and Centiskorch were Shield exclusive raids. Butterfree and Snorlax can be obtained regardless of game.
Though it is important to note, host can include players of the opposite version to join in the raids.

This event ran globally from December 31st, 2019 to January 3rd, 2020.
When this event ended, it shifted back to Wild Area Event #2 (Index 07 in this case).


## [Wild Area Event #5: Coalossal, Lapras, Flapple, Appletun](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4031-wild-area-event-5-coalossal-lapras-flapple-appletun/)
This is a wild area event held by Sword and Shield. Despite publicizing that Gigantamax variants for Coalossal, Lapras, Flapple and Appletun were to be more easily available, this event also allowed encounters for the Gigantamax variants for Alcremie.
For base game Pokémon Sword and Shield, without this event, there is no den that will enable players to encounter a non-Vanilla flavored Gigantamax Alcremie.

Coalossal and Flapple were Sword exclusive raids, and Lapras and Appletun were Shield exclusive raids.
Some non-Vanilla forms were also version exclusive, as seen below:
| Sword Raids	  |     |	Shield Raids |     |
| ---	          | --- |	---          | --- |
| Vanilla Cream | 2★ | Vanilla Cream | 2★ |
|  Mint Cream   | 3★ | Ruby Cream	   | 3★ |
| Lemon Cream   | 3★ | Matcha Cream	 | 3★ |
| Ruby Cream    | 4★ | Caramel Swirl | 4★ |
| Matcha Cream  | 4★ | Rainbow Swirl | 4★ |
| Salted Cream  | 5★ | Mint Cream    | 5★ |
| Ruby Swirl    | 5★ | Lemon Cream   | 5★ |

(All of the Gigantamax Alcremie encountered via raids, thus far, can only have the Strawberry Decoration.)
Though it is important to note, that the host can invite players of the opposite version to join in the raids.
This event ran globally from January 9th to January 30th, 2020.


## [Wild Area Event #6: Gigantamax Milcery](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4033-wild-area-event-6-gigantamax-milcery/)
This is a wild area event held by Sword and Shield. This event raid allows players to get a chance of Milcery with the Gigantamax icon.
This is the first time, that the Ribbon and Star Sweets were made available. This means that any Alcremie of any flavor and decoration that evolved from this Milcery would be capable of Gigantamaxing.

Coalossal and Flapple were Sword exclusive raids, and Lapras and Appletun were Shield exclusive raids.
Though it is important to note, that the host can invite players of the opposite version to join in the raids.

While the Milcery event was reported to run from January 31st, 2020 to February 16th, 2020,
it was reported the Flapple, Appletun, Coalossal and Lapras will rotate out on February 6th, 2020.
So chances are, this Wild Area Event will run from January 31st, 2020 to February 6th, 2020.


## [Wild Area Event #7: Gigantamax Toxtricity](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4036-wild-area-event-7-gigantamax-toxtricity/)
This is a wild area event held by Sword and Shield. This event raid allows players to obtain the Gigantamax Toxtricity that is not obtainable in the base game, and also get a chance to catch Milcery with the Gigantamax icon.
Using the Milcery with the icon, this means that any Alcremie of any flavor and decoration that evolved from this Milcery would be capable of Gigantamaxing.
This also marks the first time the Gigantamax Toxtricity is made available to players.

Grimmsnarl and Kingler were Sword exclusive raids, and Hatterene and Orbeetle were Shield exclusive raids.
Though it is important to note, that the host can invite players of the opposite version to join in the raids.

As Milcery spawns was reported to rotate out at February 17th, 2020.
this event ran will likely last from February 7th, 2020 to February 17th, 2020.

The release of this event was fraught with issues, and the servers had to redistribute the Wild Area News multiple times to try to tackle them.

Note that these are to me memory, and do not have them 100% correct. I'll replace them when proof comes along.
Index 27: Initial Release. Has bugged item (0x1604) as part of the rewards. Crashes the game upon receiving it.
(Item assumed to be Crown Tundra's version of Armorite Ore. Whoever managed the event probably put the wrong Ore item)
Index 28: The server removed the accursed item. However it appears to be bugged, perhaps server side. These raids could not be done online.
Index 29: ??? (I do not have this)
Index 30: Properly Fixed. Armorite Ore also reinstated as drop reward.
