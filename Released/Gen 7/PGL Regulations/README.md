## PGL Regulations
### What is this?
These are rules, downloaded from the _Festival Plaza_, that you can chose to use in wireless battles against your friends.

### How do I use this?
- export your games _extdata_ with a save manager like [Checkpoint](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases/latest) or [JKSM](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases/latest)
- in the _extdata_ navigate to the folder `/user/reg`, this is where regulation files are stored
- chose regulation files for your language and rename them to match the naming scheme (see below)
- import the _extdata_ back into your game

### Naming scheme
You can have up to 12 regulations at the same time. The files get numbered in the order you downloaded them, starting with `012` and ending with `023`. So any other file name that does not match `012`, `013`, `...` , `023` will not be recognized by the game.
