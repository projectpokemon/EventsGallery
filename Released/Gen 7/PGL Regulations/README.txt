What is this?
These are rules, downloaded from the Festival Plaza, that you can chose to use in wireless battles against your friends.

How do I use this?
- export your games extdata with a save manager like Checkpoint or JKSM
- in the extdata navigate to the folder /user/reg, this is where regulation files are stored
- chose regulation files for your language and rename them to match the naming scheme (see below)
- import the extdata back into your game

Naming scheme
You can have up to 12 regulations at the same time. The files get numbered in the order you downloaded them, starting with 012 and ending with 023. So any other file name that does not match 012, 013, ... , 023 will not be recognized by the game.
